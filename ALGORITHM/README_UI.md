# Smart Travel Planner - User Interface

This directory contains a web-based user interface for the Smart Travel Planner algorithm. The UI allows users to input their travel preferences and constraints, and receive personalized destination recommendations based on the interest matching algorithm.

## Components Overview

The UI consists of three main components:

1. **PreferenceForm**: Collects user preferences through both structured inputs (interest categories, importance ratings) and free-text descriptions.

2. **RecommendationResults**: Displays destination recommendations with match scores and explanations for why each destination was recommended.

3. **TravelPlanner**: Integrates the form and results components, handling the flow between user input and recommendations.

## Running the Application

To run the application locally:

1. Navigate to the landing-page directory:
   ```
   cd landing-page
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser to the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:5173)

## Integration with the Algorithm

The UI is designed to integrate with the interest scoring algorithm from Phase 1:

1. User preferences collected through the UI map directly to the interest categories in our database schema.

2. Free-text queries are processed using natural language understanding to extract implicit preferences.

3. Constraints like budget, region, and trip length are used to filter and refine recommendations.

4. The recommendation results display the explanations generated by the algorithm, showing why each destination matches the user's preferences.

## Implementation Details

- The UI is built with React and TypeScript for type safety and component reusability.
- Tailwind CSS is used for styling to ensure a responsive and modern design.
- The current implementation uses a mock API for demonstration, but is designed to be easily connected to a real backend API.

## Next Steps

1. Connect the UI to the actual scoring algorithm API
2. Add visualization of travel routes between multiple destinations
3. Implement itinerary generation functionality
4. Add user accounts for saving preferences and itineraries
5. Integrate real-time pricing data for accommodations and transportation
